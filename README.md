# Product Management @ Scale

**Hi Scrum Facilitators!**

Welcome to the Product Management @ Scale Wiki. 

## WHY play this game?

Scaling the product owner role is often a bottleneck when organisations scale. Off the shelf frameworks and methodologies often lead to the anti-pattern of having a multitude of product owners for only one product. If you intend to do this differently, sticking with just one or at least as less product owners as possible, you are probably facing the challenge of how to deal with product management in your organisation. This game facilitates a conversation about product management activities, how to deal with them while ultimately sticking to the principle of one product owner per product and hopefully helps you identify the next steps in your organisation's scaling journey! 


## To make your life easier

To make life easier, Scrum Facilitator Kai Stevens has written an extensive blog post on how to run the game. You can read it here: https://bit.ly/2On2OXK
